# Test Migration Status Report

**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Status:** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE (25% migrated)

## Executive Summary

The feature-based architecture migration using the Strangler Fig pattern has been partially completed. While the new `src/features/` structure exists with 4 domains, the test migration from Jest to Vitest is only ~25% complete. The old test structure (`src/tests/`) still contains the majority of tests and runs in parallel with the new structure.

## Current State

### Test Distribution
- **NEW Structure (`src/features/`):** 20 test files
- **OLD Structure (`src/tests/`):** 77 test files
- **Total Coverage:** Both structures run via Vitest

### Migration Status by Domain

| Domain | Feature Code | Tests in features/ | Tests in src/tests/ | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| chess-core | ✅ Migrated | 7 tests | 10+ tests | ⚠️ Duplicates exist |
| tablebase | ✅ Migrated | 7 tests | 5+ tests | ⚠️ Partial migration |
| training | ✅ Migrated | 0 tests | 5 tests | ❌ Not migrated |
| move-quality | ✅ Migrated | 6 tests | Unknown | ⚠️ Needs audit |

## Key Findings

### 1. Training Domain Gap
The `training` domain has NO tests in `src/features/training/__tests__/` despite having 5 tests in the old structure:
- `trainingSlice.test.ts`
- `TrainingBoard.test.tsx`
- `EndgameTrainingPage.test.tsx`
- `training-service.test.ts`
- Integration tests

### 2. Clear Duplicates
Chess domain has overlapping test coverage:
- **NEW:** ChessServiceFacade, MoveValidator, GermanNotation tests
- **OLD:** ChessService.*.test.ts (6 files), chessIntegration.test.ts

### 3. Configuration Issues
`vitest.unit.config.ts` includes BOTH:
- `src/features/**/*.test.tsx` (new)
- `src/tests/unit/**/*.test.tsx` (old)

This causes both test suites to run, potentially causing:
- Duplicate test execution
- Confusion about which tests are authoritative
- Increased CI/CD runtime

### 4. Dependencies
- ✅ Jest package removed from package.json
- ⚠️ `@testing-library/jest-dom` still present (v6.6.4)
- ✅ Vitest configured as primary test runner

## Why This Matters

### Risk Assessment
1. **Test Coverage Uncertainty:** With tests split across two structures, it's unclear what the actual coverage is
2. **Maintenance Burden:** Developers must maintain tests in two different patterns
3. **Performance Impact:** Running duplicate tests increases CI/CD time
4. **Technical Debt:** The longer this hybrid state persists, the harder migration becomes

### Benefits of Completing Migration
1. **Unified Testing Strategy:** Single source of truth for all tests
2. **Co-located Tests:** Tests next to implementation improves maintainability
3. **Modern Tooling:** Full Vitest benefits (faster execution, better DX)
4. **Reduced Bundle Size:** Remove old test infrastructure and dependencies

## Migration Strategy

Following the Strangler Fig pattern, we should:

1. **Migrate Missing Tests First** - Preserve coverage
2. **Consolidate Duplicates** - Merge unique test cases
3. **Remove Old Structure** - Only after validation
4. **Update Configuration** - Clean up Vitest configs

## Files Requiring Jest → Vitest Syntax Migration

83 files still contain "jest" references that need updating:
- Mock syntax: `jest.fn()` → `vi.fn()`
- Spy syntax: `jest.spyOn()` → `vi.spyOn()`
- Timer syntax: `jest.useFakeTimers()` → `vi.useFakeTimers()`
