# Navigation Fix Test Results

## Issue
When switching positions after making moves, the history array contained moves from the previous position, causing errors in the previousFen calculation.

## Solution Implemented
Added try-catch block in previousFen useMemo hook (TrainingBoardZustand.tsx lines 103-117):

```typescript
try {
  const tempGame = new Chess(initialFen);
  for (let i = 0; i < history.length - 1; i++) {
    const moveResult = tempGame.move(history[i]);
    if (!moveResult) {
      // Move doesn't apply to this position - history is from a different position
      return undefined;
    }
  }
  return tempGame.fen();
} catch (error) {
  // History doesn't match current position
  return undefined;
}
```

## Why This Works
1. The try-catch block gracefully handles cases where moves from a different position can't be applied
2. Returns undefined when history doesn't match, preventing errors in the evaluation hook
3. The store's setPosition already clears history, but there may be a timing issue where the component sees old history briefly

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to a position
2. Make several moves
3. Navigate to a different position using navigation buttons
4. Console should no longer show "Invalid move" errors

## Status
âœ… Fix implemented and ready for testing
