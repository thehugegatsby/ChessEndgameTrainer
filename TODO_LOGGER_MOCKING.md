# Logger Mocking Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem

The TestApiService test was failing because of a circular dependency issue when mocking the logger. The logger is created at the module level in TestApiService.ts:

```typescript
const logger = getLogger().setContext("TestApiService");
```

## Root Cause

- Jest hoists all `jest.mock()` calls to the top before any other code
- The mock tried to reference `mockLoggerInstance` before it was initialized
- This created a circular dependency: mock needs variable → variable needs initialization → initialization happens after mock

## Solution Implemented ✅

Create the mock object directly inside the jest.mock factory function (no external variable references):

```typescript
// Working solution:
jest.mock("../../../../shared/services/logging", () => ({
  getLogger: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
    setContext: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    info: jest.fn(),
    error: jest.fn(),
    warn: jest.fn(),
    debug: jest.fn(),
  }),
}));
```

This pattern is already successfully used in 6 other test files in the codebase.

## Architecture Analysis (from Gemini)

### Current Pattern (Module-Level Logger)
- **Pros**: Simple, low boilerplate, immediately usable
- **Cons**: Tight coupling, difficult testability, violates Dependency Inversion Principle

### Long-term Recommendation: Dependency Injection
- **Pros**: Better testability, loose coupling, flexible
- **Cons**: More boilerplate, higher initial complexity

## Future Improvements

1. **Short-term**: Consider centralizing mock creation in test utilities to avoid duplication
2. **Long-term**: 
   - Use Dependency Injection for new code
   - Refactor existing code opportunistically
   - No "Big Bang" refactoring needed

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - All tests passing with the inline mock factory pattern
