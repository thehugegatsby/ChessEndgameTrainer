3. **Advanced Achievement System** with categories, rarities, and point tracking
4. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm** for optimized learning scheduling
5. **Comprehensive Analytics** with daily/weekly/monthly statistics

## Completed Components

### 1. ProgressSlice (`/shared/store/slices/progressSlice.ts`)

**Core Domain Logic:**

```typescript
// Position-specific progress with spaced repetition
positionProgress: Record<number, PositionProgress>;

// Statistics and analytics
dailyStats: DailyStats[];
monthlyStats: MonthlyStatistics;
weeklyGoals: WeeklyGoals;

// Achievement system
achievements: Achievement[];
totalPoints: number;

// Engagement tracking
currentStreak: number;
longestStreak: number;
favoritePositions: number[];
```

**Achievement System:**

```typescript
interface Achievement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: "streak" | "completion" | "performance" | "discovery" | "mastery";
  icon: string;
  points: number;
  unlocked: boolean;
  unlockedAt?: number;
  progress: number;
  rarity: "common" | "rare" | "epic" | "legendary";
}
```

**Spaced Repetition Algorithm:**

- **Success**: Multiply interval by 2.5 (max 30 days)
- **Failure**: Reset to 1 day for new positions, or halve interval
- **First success**: 3 days
- **Minimum interval**: 1 day
- **Adaptive scheduling** based on user performance

**Actions Implemented:**

- `updatePositionProgress(id, update)`: Core progress tracking
- `addDailyStats(stats)`: Statistics aggregation with date normalization
- `unlockAchievement(id)`: Achievement system with point awards
- `toggleFavorite(id)`: User preference management
- `calculateNextReview(id, success)`: Spaced repetition scheduling
- `updateWeeklyGoals(completed, target?)`: Goal tracking
- `updateMonthlyStats(stats)`: Monthly aggregation
- `updateStreak(streak, lastActivity?)`: Engagement tracking
- `initializeAchievements(achievements)`: System setup
- `resetProgress()`: Complete state reset

**Advanced Selectors (16 selectors):**

- Basic state access (8 selectors)
- Computed analytics (8 selectors):
  - `selectTotalPositionsCompleted`: Cross-position aggregation
  - `selectOverallAccuracy`: Performance analytics
  - `selectWeeklyProgress`: Goal progress percentage
  - `selectPositionsDueForReview`: Spaced repetition scheduling

## Architecture Analysis

### 1. Complex Domain Logic Management

The ProgressSlice successfully handles sophisticated learning algorithms:

**Spaced Repetition Implementation:**

```typescript
if (success) {
  // Successful attempt - increase interval
  const currentInterval = currentProgress?.reviewInterval || 0;
  if (currentInterval === 0) {
    nextIntervalDays = 3; // First success
  } else {
    nextIntervalDays = Math.min(currentInterval * 2.5, 30); // Max 30 days
  }
} else {
  // Failed attempt - reset or decrease interval
  if (!currentProgress || currentProgress.attempts === 0) {
    nextIntervalDays = 1; // New position
  } else {
    nextIntervalDays = Math.max((currentProgress.reviewInterval || 1) / 2, 1);
  }
}
```

**Achievement System:**

- **Multi-category tracking** (streak, completion, performance, discovery, mastery)
- **Rarity system** for gamification depth
- **Point accumulation** with automatic calculation
- **Progress tracking** towards unlock conditions

### 2. Analytics and Statistics Architecture

**Time-based Data Management:**

- **Daily Statistics**: Automatic date normalization to start of day
- **Weekly Goals**: Monday-based week calculation with progress tracking
- **Monthly Aggregation**: Automatic month boundary handling
- **Recent Activity**: Time-filtered data (last 7 days)

**Performance Calculation:**

```typescript
selectOverallAccuracy: (state) => {
  const completedPositions = Object.values(state.positionProgress).filter(
    (p) => p.completed && p.accuracy !== undefined,
  );

  if (completedPositions.length === 0) return 0;

  const totalAccuracy = completedPositions.reduce(
    (sum, p) => sum + (p.accuracy || 0),
    0,
  );
  return Math.round(totalAccuracy / completedPositions.length);
};
```

### 3. State Management Patterns

**Flexible Update Pattern:**

```typescript
updatePositionProgress: (positionId, update) => {
  set((state) => ({
    positionProgress: {
      ...state.positionProgress,
      [positionId]: {
        // Start with defaults
        positionId: positionId,
        attempts: 0,
        completed: false,
        // Merge existing progress
        ...state.positionProgress[positionId],
        // Apply update
        ...update,
      },
    },
  }));
};
```

**Date Normalization for Statistics:**

```typescript
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Normalize to start of day
const todayTimestamp = today.getTime();

// Check if we already have stats for today
const existingIndex = state.dailyStats.findIndex(
  (stat) => stat.date === todayTimestamp,
);
```

## Next Steps Analysis

### Immediate Priority: SettingsSlice

**SettingsSlice Arguments:**

- **Configuration management** patterns
- **Preference persistence** with defaults
- **Theme and display settings** integration

### After SettingsSlice: Integration Phase

1. **UserSlice** (if needed) or combine with ProgressSlice
2. **Root Store Assembly** with all slices
3. **Migration Strategy** from monolithic store
4. **Orchestrator Integration Tests**
5. **Performance optimization** and cleanup

## Questions for Review

1. **Spaced Repetition Algorithm**: Is the current algorithm sophisticated enough, or should we consider more advanced models (SM-2, SM-17)?

2. **Achievement Unlock Conditions**: Should achievement unlock logic be in the slice or handled by external services?

3. **Statistics Retention**: Should we implement automatic cleanup of old statistics, or maintain unlimited history?

4. **Goal System Expansion**: Should we add daily/monthly goals in addition to weekly goals?

5. **Performance Optimization**: Are the current selector patterns efficient enough for large datasets?

6. **Data Persistence**: Should statistics and achievements be persisted differently than other state?
