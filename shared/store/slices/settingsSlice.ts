/**
 * @file Minimal settings slice - drastically reduced from 869 lines
 * @module store/slices/settingsSlice
 * @description MAJOR CLEANUP: Reduced settings slice to only essential functionality.
 * All unused features removed as they were not used anywhere in the codebase.
 * 
 * @remarks
 * **Before:** 869 lines of complex unused settings (theme, notifications, difficulty, etc.)
 * **After:** ~100 lines with only essential restart functionality
 * 
 * **Removed unused features:**
 * - Theme settings (no UI components use them)
 * - Notification preferences (no notification system)
 * - Difficulty settings (no difficulty system)
 * - Privacy settings (no privacy features)
 * - Experimental features (no feature flags used)
 * - Data sync (no sync functionality)
 * - Localization (not implemented)
 * 
 * **Kept essential features:**
 * - Restart required flag (might be needed)
 * - Settings update timestamp (minimal state tracking)
 * - Backward compatible action stubs (prevent breaking changes)

/**
 * Creates minimal settings slice for the Zustand store
 * 
 * @param set - Zustand's set function for immutable state updates
 * @param _get - Zustand's get function for accessing current state
 * @returns {SettingsSlice} Minimal settings slice with only essential functionality
 * 
 * @remarks
 * This replaces the 869-line complex settings implementation with a minimal
 * version containing only what's actually needed. Follows YAGNI principle.
 * 
 * Actions are kept for backward compatibility but most are no-ops since
 * the features they managed were unused.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Only meaningful usage
 * const restartRequired = useStore(state => state.restartRequired);
 * const clearRestartRequired = useStore(state => state.clearRestartRequired);
 * 
 * // Set restart flag when needed
 * if (criticalSettingChanged) {
 *   store.getState().clearRestartRequired(); // Clear flag after restart
 * }
 * ```
