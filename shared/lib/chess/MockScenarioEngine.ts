/**
 * TEMPORARILY COMMENTED OUT - Needs refactoring for clean architecture
 * 
 * @fileoverview Mock Chess Engine for E2E Tests - Registry-Based
 * @version 2.0.0
 * @description Lightning-fast mock engine using centralized TestPositions registry.
 * TODO: Refactor to implement IChessEngine interface instead of old IScenarioEngine
 * 
 * DESIGN GOALS:
 * - Zero latency: Instant responses for fast tests
 * - Deterministic: Same input always produces same output
 * - Registry-based: Uses central TestPositions as single source of truth
 * - API Compatible: Drop-in replacement for ChessEngine
 * - Error-first: Throws clear errors for unmapped positions
