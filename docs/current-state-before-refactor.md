# Current State Documentation - Before Refactor
Date: 2025-08-20

## ✅ Working Features

### Core Chess Functionality
- ✅ Chess board display with react-chessboard
- ✅ Legal move validation via chess.js
- ✅ Move input (click-to-move and drag & drop)
- ✅ Move history tracking
- ✅ Position loading from FEN strings
- ✅ Game state management (check, checkmate, stalemate)

### Training Features
- ✅ Firebase position loading
- ✅ Training flow (player move → validation → opponent response)
- ✅ Tablebase integration for move evaluation
- ✅ Move quality feedback (correct/incorrect)
- ✅ Streak tracking
- ✅ Position navigation (next/previous)

### UI/UX Features
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- ✅ Dark/light theme support
- ✅ Sound effects for moves
- ✅ Move animations
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Dialog system (promotion, errors)
- ✅ Command palette (Cmd+K)

### Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ E2E tests with Playwright
- ✅ Unit tests with Vitest
- ✅ Test API for E2E mode
- ✅ Firebase emulator support

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Architecture Problems
- ❌ 500+ line god function (handlePlayerMove)
- ❌ 7+ abstraction layers for simple moves
- ❌ Duplicated move parsing logic in 4 places
- ❌ State synchronization issues between stores
- ❌ Circular dependencies between services

### Test Issues
- ⚠️ 28 failing unit tests (mostly in move handling)
- ⚠️ TypeScript errors in test files
- ⚠️ E2E tests fragile due to architecture

### Performance Issues
- ⚠️ Unnecessary re-renders
- ⚠️ Memory leaks from event listeners
- ⚠️ Slow initial load (~3-4s)

## 📊 Code Metrics

### Current Statistics
- **Total Lines of Code**: ~2000+ in core logic
- **Largest File**: handlePlayerMove/index.ts (500+ lines)
- **Test Coverage**: ~60% (but many tests failing)
- **Build Time**: ~45s
- **Bundle Size**: ~2.5MB

### File Count by Domain
```
src/domains/game/        - 15 files
src/domains/evaluation/  - 12 files  
src/domains/training/    - 20 files
src/shared/store/        - 35 files
src/shared/services/     - 25 files
src/shared/hooks/        - 18 files
```

## 🎯 Refactor Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Reduce code from 2000+ to ~500 lines
2. Eliminate god functions
3. Single source of truth (chess.js)
4. Event-driven architecture
5. Clean service boundaries

### Success Metrics
- Build time <10s
- Test execution <5s
- 100% passing tests
- Bundle size <1.5MB
- Feature implementation in hours not days
