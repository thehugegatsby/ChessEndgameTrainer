## Learnings Log

### Claude Code Hooks Broken in WSL2
**Date:** 2025-01-13  
**Tags:** `WSL`, `Claude-Code`, `Hooks`, `Automation`  
**Commit:** -

**Problem/Context:**
> Attempted to use Claude Code hooks to automatically document learnings after sessions. Hooks configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` was recognized but commands were never executed. Multiple syntax variations tested, including examples from official docs and community repos.

**Solution/Learning:**
> Claude Code hooks are fundamentally broken in WSL2 environments (confirmed in GitHub issues #3579, #3091). The hook runner starts but doesn't execute commands. Workaround: Use Git pre-commit hooks with husky instead - they run locally and can enforce learning documentation before commits. Alternative: Package.json script redirects for common mistakes.

### WSL2 Node.js Pipe Restriction
**Date:** 2025-01-13  
**Tags:** `WSL`, `Node.js`, `Testing`, `Commands`  
**Commit:** -

**Problem/Context:**
> Commands like `pnpm test 2>&1 | tail` or `npm run build | grep error` cause hangs/crashes in WSL2 with Node.js tools. Claude Code frequently generates these patterns.

**Solution/Learning:**
> Never use pipes (`|`) or stderr redirection (`2>&1`) with Node.js commands in WSL2. Use `&&` for command chaining instead. Direct path arguments work: `pnpm test path/to/test.tsx` instead of `pnpm test -- --run path/to/test.tsx`.

### Test Framework Split Strategy
**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Tags:** `Testing`, `Jest`, `Vitest`, `Architecture`  
**Commit:** -

**Problem/Context:**
> Project uses both Jest (for `src/shared/`) and Vitest (for `src/features/`). This split caused confusion and configuration issues.

**Solution/Learning:**
> The split is intentional: Jest for business logic/services (shared), Vitest for React components (features). Never use `pnpm run test:jest` or `pnpm run test:vitest` directly - use `pnpm test` with path patterns. Package.json redirects catch common mistakes.

## Quick Reference

**Common Issues:**
- ðŸš« Hooks don't work â†’ Use Git hooks instead
- ðŸš« Pipes break Node â†’ Use && or direct paths
- ðŸš« Wrong test command â†’ Let package.json redirect handle it

**Useful Patterns:**
- âœ… `SKIP_LEARNINGS_CHECK=1 git commit` - bypass learning check for trivial commits
- âœ… `pnpm test services` - run all service tests
- âœ… Direct file paths in test commands

### Git Pre-commit Hook Optimization
**Date:** 2025-01-13  
**Tags:** `Git`, `Hooks`, `Performance`, `Workflow`  
**Commit:** -

**Problem/Context:**
> Initial pre-commit hook ran full test suite on every commit, causing significant delays. Also had misleading variable naming (COMMIT_MSG contained file list) and redundant git diff calls.

**Solution/Learning:**
> Move test execution to pre-push hook to maintain fast commit workflow while still ensuring quality before code reaches remote. Optimize git operations by caching staged files list. This balances enforcement with developer experience - commits stay fast, pushes stay safe.
