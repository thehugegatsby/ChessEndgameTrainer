# Unified Evaluation System - Migration Tasks

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Analyze experimental version improvements
- [x] Create baseline tests for current evaluation behavior
- [x] Define compatibility interfaces
- [x] Setup feature flag infrastructure

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [x] Copy unified evaluation components from experimental
  - [x] UnifiedEvaluationService
  - [x] EvaluationNormalizer
  - [x] PlayerPerspectiveTransformer
  - [x] EvaluationFormatter
  - [x] MoveQualityAnalyzer
  - [x] Provider interfaces
  - [x] Monitoring system
- [x] Create Logger compatibility layer
- [x] Fix all import paths and type issues
- [x] Create cache adapter for LRUCache
- [x] Ensure build passes

### Phase 3: Integration
- [x] Implement feature flag (USE_UNIFIED_EVALUATION_SYSTEM)
- [x] Create hook wrapper (useEvaluationWrapper)
- [x] Update hook exports transparently
- [x] Test with flag enabled/disabled
- [x] Add integration tests

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [x] Create migration guide
- [x] Document architecture decisions
- [x] Create rollback procedures

## üöß Current Tasks

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite with new system
- [ ] Fix failing tests for unified system
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (old vs new)
- [ ] Memory usage analysis
- [ ] Bundle size impact assessment

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Setup monitoring for evaluation discrepancies
- [ ] Create dashboards for A/B testing
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Plan gradual rollout strategy

## üìã Upcoming Tasks

### Phase 5: Gradual Rollout
- [ ] Enable for internal testing (developers)
- [ ] Enable for 1% of users
- [ ] Monitor metrics and errors
- [ ] Gradual increase to 10%, 50%, 100%

### Phase 6: Cleanup
- [ ] Remove legacy evaluation code
- [ ] Remove compatibility layers
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Archive migration guides

## üîß Technical Debt to Address

### High Priority
- [ ] Add cache statistics to hook wrapper
- [ ] Implement proper TTL in LRUCacheAdapter
- [ ] Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Improve type safety for providers

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (tree-shaking)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create developer tools for debugging
- [ ] Add feature flag UI for admins

### Low Priority
- [ ] Refactor test structure
- [ ] Add more edge case tests
- [ ] Document internal APIs
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams

## üìä Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] All existing features work identically
- [ ] Black perspective bug is fixed
- [ ] No regression in evaluation accuracy

### Performance
- [ ] Evaluation latency ‚â§ current system
- [ ] Memory usage ‚â§ current system
- [ ] Bundle size increase < 5KB

### Quality
- [ ] Test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] Positive developer feedback

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Performance regression**: Mitigated by caching and parallel evaluation
2. **Breaking changes**: Mitigated by feature flag and compatibility layer
3. **Bundle size**: Monitor and optimize if needed
4. **User confusion**: Keep UI identical during migration

### Rollback Plan
1. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_UNIFIED_EVAL=false`
2. Deploy immediately
3. Investigate issues offline
4. Fix and retry migration

## üìÖ Timeline Estimates

- **Week 1**: Testing and validation ‚úÖ
- **Week 2**: Production readiness
- **Week 3**: Begin gradual rollout
- **Week 4-6**: Monitor and increase rollout
- **Week 7-8**: Cleanup and documentation

## ü§ù Stakeholders

- **Engineering**: Implementation and testing
- **QA**: Validation and edge cases
- **Product**: Success metrics and rollout strategy
- **DevOps**: Monitoring and deployment

## üìù Notes

- Keep feature flag for at least 30 days after 100% rollout
- Document all issues and learnings
- Consider creating a case study for future migrations
- Plan celebration when migration is complete! üéâ
