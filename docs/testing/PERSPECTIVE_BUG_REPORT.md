# ✅ Bug Fix Report: Perspective Transformation Fixed

## Summary
The `PlayerPerspectiveTransformer` component had a critical bug where it did NOT invert evaluation values for Black's perspective. This bug has been **FIXED** as of 2025-01-16.

## Impact
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Component**: `/shared/lib/chess/evaluation/perspectiveTransformer.ts`
- **Affected Users**: All players playing as Black
- **Business Impact**: Black players see incorrect evaluations (positive when losing, negative when winning)

## Technical Details

### Current Behavior (INCORRECT)
```typescript
// Lines 49-60 in perspectiveTransformer.ts
return {
  ...normalizedEval,
  perspective: validatedPerspective,
  perspectiveScore: normalizedEval.scoreInCentipawns,  // NO INVERSION!
  perspectiveMate: normalizedEval.mate,                // NO INVERSION!
  perspectiveWdl: normalizedEval.wdl,                  // NO INVERSION!
  perspectiveDtm: normalizedEval.dtm,                  // NO INVERSION!
  perspectiveDtz: normalizedEval.dtz                   // NO INVERSION!
};
```

### Expected Behavior
For Black perspective (`perspective === 'b'`), all values should be inverted:
- Positive scores → Negative (White advantage becomes Black disadvantage)
- Negative scores → Positive (Black advantage shown as positive)
- Mate values inverted (being mated shown as negative)
- WDL values inverted (White win = -2 for Black)

### Root Cause
The comment on line 49 states:
> "The normalized values are already correctly oriented for the player-to-move who was specified during normalization. We don't need to invert them again"

This is incorrect. The `NormalizedEvaluation` type explicitly states (line 98):
> "All values are from White's perspective for consistency"

## Test Evidence
Created comprehensive unit tests in `/tests/unit/lib/chess/evaluation/perspectiveTransformer.test.ts`:
- 16 tests total, all passing
- 3 tests explicitly document the bug behavior
- Performance test shows transformation is efficient (<5ms for 10,000 operations)

## Proposed Fix

```typescript
transform(
  normalizedEval: NormalizedEvaluation | null | undefined,
  perspective: 'w' | 'b'
): PlayerPerspectiveEvaluation {
  if (!normalizedEval) {
    return this.createDefaultPerspectiveEvaluation('w');
  }

  const validatedPerspective = this.validatePerspective(perspective);
  
  // FIXED: Apply inversion for Black perspective
  const invert = validatedPerspective === 'b';
  
  return {
    ...normalizedEval,
    perspective: validatedPerspective,
    perspectiveScore: invert ? this.invertValue(normalizedEval.scoreInCentipawns) : normalizedEval.scoreInCentipawns,
    perspectiveMate: invert ? this.invertValue(normalizedEval.mate) : normalizedEval.mate,
    perspectiveWdl: invert ? this.invertValue(normalizedEval.wdl) : normalizedEval.wdl,
    perspectiveDtm: invert ? this.invertValue(normalizedEval.dtm) : normalizedEval.dtm,
    perspectiveDtz: invert ? this.invertValue(normalizedEval.dtz) : normalizedEval.dtz
  };
}
```

## Verification Steps
1. Run tests: `npm test -- tests/unit/lib/chess/evaluation/perspectiveTransformer.test.ts`
2. Update test expectations after fix
3. Test UI with Black pieces to verify correct display

## Related Components
- `pipelineFactory.ts` - Uses the transformer
- `formatter.ts` - Formats the perspective values for display
- UI components displaying evaluations

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Fix the bug in perspectiveTransformer
2. **Short-term**: Add integration tests for Black perspective
3. **Long-term**: Implement the White-perspective standardization as suggested in the architecture review

## Fix Applied
The bug was fixed by properly implementing value inversion for Black's perspective:
- Added `shouldInvert` check for Black perspective
- Applied `invertValue()` to all evaluation metrics when perspective is 'b'
- Updated all unit tests to expect correct inverted values
- All 16 tests now pass successfully
