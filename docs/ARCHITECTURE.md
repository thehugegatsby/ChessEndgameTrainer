# ChessEndgameTrainer Architecture

## State Management Philosophy

We use Zustand with domain-specific slices and actions. The store is the Single Source of Truth - no component maintains chess state locally. All state mutations go through actions for consistency.

## Current Architecture: Domain-Specific Slices (v3.9)

```
TablebaseService (Lichess API)
         ↓
  Zustand RootStore (domain slices)
         ↓
  React Components
```

### Domain-Specific Slices Architecture

The store is organized into focused, domain-specific slices:

- **GameSlice**: Chess game state, moves, position management
- **TrainingSlice**: Training sessions, progress tracking, scenarios
- **TablebaseSlice**: Tablebase evaluations, analysis status, cache management
- **UISlice**: Interface state, toasts, sidebar, modal management
- **ProgressSlice**: User progress, achievements, statistics
- **SettingsSlice**: User preferences, themes, notifications
- **UserSlice**: Authentication, profile, preferences

Cross-slice operations are handled by orchestrators in `/shared/store/orchestrators/`.

## Key Services & Components

### 1. **ChessService** (`/shared/services/ChessService.ts`) - 740 lines ⚠️

- **ISSUE**: Singleton anti-pattern with complex initialization
- Chess.js wrapper managing game state
- Move validation and history management
- Event emitter for state changes
- **Tech Debt**: Should be refactored to repository pattern

### 2. **TablebaseService** (`/shared/services/TablebaseService.ts`) - 405 lines

- Lichess tablebase API integration
- Smart LRU cache with FEN normalization
- Request deduplication for concurrent calls
- Zod schema validation
- Well-structured and maintainable ✅

### 3. **Logger Service** (`/shared/services/logging/Logger.ts`) - 1082 lines ⚠️

- **ISSUE**: Massive service with 59+ public methods
- Handles all logging across the application
- **Tech Debt**: Should be split into smaller modules

### 4. **Zustand Store** (`/shared/store/`)

- `rootStore.ts` - Combined store with all domain slices
- `slices/` - Individual domain-specific slices
- `orchestrators/handlePlayerMove/` - 2202 lines across 7 files ⚠️
- **ISSUE**: Over-engineered move handling with excessive abstraction

### 5. **React Hooks** (`/shared/hooks/`)

- `useTrainingSession` - Main training interface
- `usePositionAnalysis` - Tablebase evaluation
- Performance-optimized with proper memoization

### 6. **Store Hooks Pattern** (`/shared/store/hooks/`)

- Three-hook pattern for each slice:
  - `useXxxState()` - Returns reactive state
  - `useXxxActions()` - Returns stable action references
  - `useXxxStore()` - Returns [state, actions] tuple
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders ✅

## Critical Technical Debt Issues

### 1. **Service Layer Bloat** (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **Logger**: 1082 lines, 59+ methods - needs modularization
- **ChessService**: 740 lines singleton - needs repository pattern
- **TestApiService**: 716 lines of test code mixed with production

### 2. **Orchestrator Over-Engineering** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- `handlePlayerMove`: 2202 lines split across 7 files
- Complex abstraction for simple move validation
- Should be simplified to 200-300 lines total

### 3. **Missing Abstractions** (LOW PRIORITY)

- No repository pattern for data access
- Direct Firebase coupling throughout codebase
- No service interfaces for testing

### 4. **Test Infrastructure** (RESOLVED ✅)

- 1417 tests running (98.9% pass rate)
- 14 failing tests need investigation
- Good coverage overall

## Data Flow Examples

### Move Execution Flow

```
User clicks square → TrainingBoard component
                           ↓
                    useTrainingSession hook
                           ↓
                    trainingActions.handlePlayerMove()
                           ↓
                    Orchestrator validation (2202 lines!)
                           ↓
                    ChessService.move()
                           ↓
                    Store state update
                           ↓
                    Component re-renders
```

### Position Evaluation Flow

```
Position changes → usePositionAnalysis hook
                          ↓
                  TablebaseService.getEvaluation()
                          ↓
                  LRU Cache check
                          ↓
                  Lichess API (if not cached)
                          ↓
                  Store update
                          ↓
                  UI re-render
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Bundle Size**: ~300KB per route (optimized)
- **API Calls**: 75% reduction through caching
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 99.9% for repeated positions
- **Test Suite**: 1417 tests in ~30 seconds

## Architecture Strengths ✅

1. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
3. **Performance**: Excellent caching and optimization
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Architecture Weaknesses ⚠️

1. **Service Bloat**: Some services exceed 1000 lines
2. **Over-Engineering**: Orchestrator pattern too complex
3. **Coupling**: Direct Firebase dependencies
4. **Singleton Usage**: Anti-patterns in critical services

## Recommended Refactoring Priority

1. **HIGH**: Split Logger service into modules
2. **HIGH**: Simplify handlePlayerMove orchestrator
3. **MEDIUM**: Convert ChessService to repository pattern
4. **LOW**: Abstract Firebase behind interfaces
5. **LOW**: Clean up test infrastructure files
