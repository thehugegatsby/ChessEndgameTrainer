# Archived Migration Plans

This directory contains migration plans and documentation that were created but never fully implemented.

## Archived Documents

### MIGRATION_GUIDE_STRANGLER_FIG.md
- **Created:** 2024
- **Status:** ~25% implemented
- **Issue:** Over-engineered approach with Feature Flags and Strangler Fig pattern
- **Reality:** Most features were never migrated, feature flags barely used

### TEST_MIGRATION_STATUS.md & TEST_MIGRATION_TODO.md  
- **Created:** 2025-08-13
- **Status:** Partially accurate assessment
- **Issue:** Described complex phased migration that was never executed
- **Reality:** Jest was removed, Vitest added, but test structure migration incomplete

## Why Archived?

These documents described ambitious architectural changes that proved to be over-complicated for the actual needs of the project. The reality is:

1. **Feature Flags:** Implemented but only used in 3 files
2. **Strangler Fig Pattern:** Components created but not actively used
3. **Test Migration:** 75% of tests still in old structure
4. **Phases 1-5:** Never started

## Current State (2025-08-13)

- Vitest is the test runner (Jest removed)
- Tests split between `src/tests/` (75%) and `src/features/` (25%)
- No active feature flag usage in production code
- Simple, working codebase without unnecessary abstractions

## Lesson Learned

Sometimes simpler is better. The codebase works fine without the complex migration patterns.
