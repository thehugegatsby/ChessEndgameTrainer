# Component Tests Implementation - BoardComponent Success

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive component tests for BoardComponent with 100% test pass rate (17/17 tests).

## Problems Solved

### 1. Logger Dependency Issue
**Problem**: `TypeError: this.logger.setContext is not a function`
- BoardComponent extends BaseComponent which has logger dependency
- Initial inline jest.mock() didn't work due to import path mismatches

**Solution**: Manual mock in `__mocks__` directory with proper logger mock implementation

### 2. Module Resolution Issue
**Problem**: Jest couldn't find the mocked BaseComponent
- BoardComponent imports with relative path: `'./BaseComponent'`
- Test uses different path: `'../../e2e/components/BaseComponent'`
- Manual mocks weren't being picked up

**Investigation with AI Models**:
- Used stack traces to identify that real BaseComponent was being loaded
- Gemini recommended relocating __mocks__ or using jest.spyOn
- O3 recommended moduleNameMapper configuration

**Solution**: Updated `jest.config.components.js` with moduleNameMapper:
```javascript
moduleNameMapper: {
  '(.*)/BaseComponent$': '<rootDir>/tests/e2e/components/__mocks__/BaseComponent.ts'
}
```

### 3. Async Test Debugging
**Problem**: console.log statements weren't appearing in failing tests
- Tests were timing out due to infinite loops in mocks
- Jest was killing tests before output could flush

**Solution**: 
- Increased Jest timeout to 30 seconds for debugging
- Used process.stdout.write for direct output
- Fixed mock implementations to avoid infinite loops

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

1. **jest.config.components.js**
   - Added moduleNameMapper for BaseComponent resolution
   - Configured coverage and test paths for E2E components

2. **tests/e2e/components/__mocks__/BaseComponent.ts**
   - Complete mock implementation with all required methods
   - Mock logger with chainable methods
   - Debug output in waitForElement

3. **tests/components/__tests__/BoardComponent.test.ts**
   - 17 comprehensive tests covering:
     - Board initialization (waitForBoard)
     - Move handling (e2e_makeMove + click-to-click)
     - FEN handling and validation
     - Piece detection
     - Highlight detection
     - Position loading
     - Move validation

4. **tests/components/__mocks__/playwright.ts**
   - Factory functions for creating mock Page and Locator objects
   - Type-safe mocks matching Playwright API

## Test Results
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       17 passed, 17 total
Time:        0.928 s
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Mock Resolution**: Jest's manual mocks must be in specific locations or configured via moduleNameMapper
2. **Debug Strategy**: Stack traces are invaluable for understanding mock chain issues
3. **AI Collaboration**: Different AI models provided complementary solutions
   - Gemini focused on architectural solutions
   - O3 provided pragmatic configuration fixes

## Next Steps
- Implement TestBridgeWrapper tests (Task 3.8)
- Continue with MoveListComponent tests
- Integrate component tests with ModernDriver
