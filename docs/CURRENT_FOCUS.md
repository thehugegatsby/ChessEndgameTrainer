## 🎯 Active Development

**🚀 LATEST ACHIEVEMENT: Performance-Optimized State/Action Hook Split Pattern!**

Following the successful Phase 8 Store Refactoring, we've implemented Gemini's performance optimization suggestion for preventing unnecessary re-renders in action-only components.

## 🔄 Recent Architecture Changes

### 🚀 Phase 8 Store Refactoring (JUST COMPLETED - MAJOR MILESTONE!)

**Historic achievement**: Complete transformation from monolithic to domain-specific architecture:

- ✅ **Monolithic store.ts (1,298 lines)** → **7 focused domain slices**
- ✅ **All TypeScript errors resolved** (0 compilation errors)
- ✅ **All 823 tests passing** with proper Immer middleware patterns
- ✅ **Branded types implementation** with controlled test factories
- ✅ **Cross-slice orchestrators** for complex operations
- ✅ **Clean separation of concerns** with domain-driven design

**Architecture transformation**:

- GameSlice: Chess game state, moves, position management
- TrainingSlice: Training sessions, progress tracking, scenarios
- TablebaseSlice: Tablebase evaluations, analysis status, cache
- ProgressSlice: User progress, achievements, statistics, spaced repetition
- UISlice: Interface state, toasts, sidebar, modal management
- SettingsSlice: User preferences, themes, notifications
- UserSlice: Authentication, profile, preferences

### TablebaseService Optimization (Just Completed)

Major architectural improvements based on AI review:

- **Single API call architecture**: Reduced N+1 pattern to 1 call for `getTopMoves`
- **Smart caching**: FEN normalization removes halfmove/fullmove counters
- **Request deduplication**: Concurrent calls share the same promise
- **Zod validation**: Type-safe API response handling
- **100% test coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with 20 tests

### Architecture Improvements (Just Completed)

Based on AI assistant reviews (Gemini & o3):

- **AnalysisService**: Extracted common formatting logic from hooks and store actions
- **React Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling for TablebasePanel
- **TypeScript improvements**: Removed all `any` types from store actions
- **Clean architecture**: No overengineering, appropriate abstractions

### Performance Optimization: State/Action Hook Split (Just Completed)

Major performance improvement implementing Gemini's suggestion:

- **Three-hook pattern** for each store slice:
  - `useXxxState()`: Returns reactive state (with useShallow optimization)
  - `useXxxActions()`: Returns stable action references (never re-renders)
  - `useXxxStore()`: Returns [state, actions] tuple for convenience
- **Zero re-renders** for action-only components (e.g., button controls)
- **Full TypeScript type safety** maintained throughout
- **All components migrated** to new tuple pattern
- **Comprehensive documentation** in `/shared/store/hooks/README.md`

### Complete E2E Test Cleanup (Completed)

E2E test suite cleaned up and modernized:

- **Removed obsolete tests**: `modern-driver-api.spec.ts`, `app-platform-integration.spec.ts` (~800 lines)
- **Updated terminology**: All "engine" references → "tablebase" in E2E tests (11 edits across 3 files)
- **Optimized configuration**: Next.js config optimized for E2E tests
- **Documentation**: Cross-origin warnings documented as minor HMR-related issue

### Clean Cut Migration (Completed)

All references to "engine" have been renamed to "tablebase":

- `requestEngineMove` → `requestTablebaseMove`
- `isEngineThinking` → removed (use `analysisStatus === 'loading'`)
- `engineStatus` → `analysisStatus`
- `ErrorType.CHESS_ENGINE` → `ErrorType.TABLEBASE`

### State Simplification

- Removed redundant `isAnalyzing` field
- `analysisStatus` now handles all states: `idle | loading | success | error`
- `tablebaseMove` uses `string | null | undefined` pattern

## 📍 Where to Find Current Issues

The single source of truth for all issues is GitHub Issues:

- **Bug Reports**: https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:bug
- **Feature Requests**: https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:enhancement

## 🐛 Common Problem Patterns

When debugging, pay special attention to:

1. **Tablebase API Errors**
   - Rate limiting from Lichess API
   - Invalid FEN strings causing API rejections
   - Network timeouts (7 second timeout configured)

2. **State Synchronization**
   - Store updates not triggering re-renders
   - Race conditions between user moves and tablebase responses
   - Stale closures in event handlers

3. **Component Rendering**
   - Missing data in move display components
   - Conditional rendering based on wrong state fields
   - Props not properly passed down component tree

## 🧪 Testing Focus Areas

**Current test infrastructure status**: 721+ tests passing ✅

When working on new features, ensure tests cover:

- Tablebase API error scenarios
- State transitions during move execution
- Component rendering with various data states
- FEN validation edge cases
- **NEW**: Individual slice testing with proper Immer middleware
- **NEW**: Cross-slice orchestrator integration tests
- **NEW**: Branded type validation in test utilities

## 📝 Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. Root cause identified and fixed (for bugs)
2. Unit tests added/updated for affected slices
3. TypeScript compilation passes with 0 errors
4. All 721+ tests pass
5. Manual testing confirms functionality
6. No regression in existing functionality
7. Code follows domain-slice architecture patterns
8. **NEW**: Proper slice separation maintained (no cross-slice state access)
9. **NEW**: Orchestrators used for complex cross-slice operations
