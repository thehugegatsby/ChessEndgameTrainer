Follow the format below to ensure your issue can be efficiently processed by AI assistants.

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Use clear, structured sections with emoji headers
- Provide machine-verifiable success criteria
- Include specific examples and patterns
- Structure acceptance criteria as actionable items
- Use consistent formatting throughout
-->

## üéØ Task Overview

<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Provide a clear, concise description of what needs to be done.
Good: "Extract magic numbers from chess engine configuration into named constants"
Bad: "Fix the numbers in the code"
-->

**Brief Description:** 
[One sentence describing the task]

**Scope:** 
[Specify which files, modules, or areas of code are affected]

**Context:** 
[Explain why this task is needed and how it fits into the broader project]

## üéñÔ∏è Machine-Verifiable Success Criteria

<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: List specific, testable criteria that can be automatically verified.
Use checkboxes for each criterion. Include commands that can verify success.

GOOD EXAMPLES:
- [ ] All magic numbers > 100 in `/shared/lib/engine/` are extracted to constants
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] No new TypeScript errors: `npm run build`

BAD EXAMPLES:
- [ ] Code looks better
- [ ] Numbers are more readable
-->

- [ ] **Criterion 1:** [Specific, measurable outcome]
  - **Verification:** `command to verify`
- [ ] **Criterion 2:** [Specific, measurable outcome]
  - **Verification:** `command to verify`
- [ ] **Criterion 3:** [Specific, measurable outcome]
  - **Verification:** `command to verify`

## üìã Detailed Requirements

### Target Patterns
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Specify exactly what patterns to look for in the code.
Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for clarity.
-->

**Find these patterns:**
```typescript
// Pattern 1: Magic numbers in configuration
const config = {
  depth: 15,        // ‚Üê Extract this
  time: 5000,       // ‚Üê Extract this
  nodes: 1000000    // ‚Üê Extract this
};

// Pattern 2: Hardcoded thresholds
if (score > 200) {  // ‚Üê Extract this
  // logic
}
```

**Replace with:**
```typescript
// Extracted constants
const ENGINE_CONFIG = {
  DEFAULT_DEPTH: 15,
  DEFAULT_TIME_MS: 5000,
  DEFAULT_NODES: 1000000
} as const;

const SCORE_THRESHOLDS = {
  WINNING_THRESHOLD: 200
} as const;

// Updated usage
const config = {
  depth: ENGINE_CONFIG.DEFAULT_DEPTH,
  time: ENGINE_CONFIG.DEFAULT_TIME_MS,
  nodes: ENGINE_CONFIG.DEFAULT_NODES
};

if (score > SCORE_THRESHOLDS.WINNING_THRESHOLD) {
  // logic
}
```

### Exclusion Criteria
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Specify what NOT to change to prevent over-extraction.
-->

**Do NOT extract:**
- Single-use values that are self-explanatory (e.g., `array.length - 1`)
- Standard constants (e.g., `0`, `1`, `true`, `false`)
- Values that are context-dependent and don't represent domain concepts
- Test-specific values unless they're reused across multiple tests

### File Scope
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: List specific files or directories to process.
Use glob patterns where appropriate.
-->

**Target Files:**
- `shared/lib/engine/**/*.ts`
- `shared/lib/tablebase/**/*.ts`
- `shared/hooks/useChessGame.ts`
- `shared/services/**.ts`

**Exclude Files:**
- `tests/**/*` (unless constants are reused)
- `*.test.ts` files
- `node_modules/**/*`

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Specify how constants should be named for consistency.
-->

```typescript
// Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
const ENGINE_DEFAULTS = {
  MAX_DEPTH: 20,
  TIMEOUT_MS: 30000,
  HASH_SIZE_MB: 256
} as const;

// Group related constants logically
const CHESS_PIECE_VALUES = {
  PAWN: 100,
  KNIGHT: 320,
  BISHOP: 330,
  ROOK: 500,
  QUEEN: 900
} as const;
```

### File Organization
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Specify where constants should be placed.
-->

1. **Create/Update:** `shared/constants/index.ts`
2. **Group by domain:** Engine, Tablebase, UI, etc.
3. **Export pattern:**
   ```typescript
   export const ENGINE_CONFIG = { ... } as const;
   export const TABLEBASE_CONFIG = { ... } as const;
   ```

### Code Quality Requirements
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Specify quality standards for the changes.
-->

- All constants must be typed with `as const`
- JSDoc comments required for non-obvious constants
- Group constants logically by domain/feature
- Maintain existing code functionality (no behavior changes)
- Follow existing project TypeScript style

## üìù Expected Deliverables

## üí° Examples

### Good Extraction Example
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Show a complete before/after example.
-->

**Before:**
```typescript
// shared/lib/engine/stockfish.ts
export class StockfishEngine {
  private initEngine() {
    this.postMessage(`setoption name Hash value 256`);
    this.postMessage(`setoption name Threads value 1`);
    this.postMessage(`setoption name Depth value 15`);
  }
  
  private evaluatePosition() {
    if (this.timeElapsed > 5000) {
      this.stopEvaluation();
    }
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// shared/constants/index.ts
export const ENGINE_CONFIG = {
  DEFAULT_HASH_MB: 256,
  DEFAULT_THREADS: 1,
  DEFAULT_DEPTH: 15,
  EVALUATION_TIMEOUT_MS: 5000
} as const;

// shared/lib/engine/stockfish.ts
import { ENGINE_CONFIG } from '../../constants';

export class StockfishEngine {
  private initEngine() {
    this.postMessage(`setoption name Hash value ${ENGINE_CONFIG.DEFAULT_HASH_MB}`);
    this.postMessage(`setoption name Threads value ${ENGINE_CONFIG.DEFAULT_THREADS}`);
    this.postMessage(`setoption name Depth value ${ENGINE_CONFIG.DEFAULT_DEPTH}`);
  }
  
  private evaluatePosition() {
    if (this.timeElapsed > ENGINE_CONFIG.EVALUATION_TIMEOUT_MS) {
      this.stopEvaluation();
    }
  }
}
```

### Bad Extraction Example
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Show what NOT to do.
-->

**‚ùå Don't extract obvious or single-use values:**
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS
const ARRAY_OPERATIONS = {
  LAST_INDEX_OFFSET: 1,  // for array.length - 1
  ZERO: 0,               // obvious value
  TRUE: true             // standard boolean
} as const;

// DON'T DO THIS
for (let i = ARRAY_OPERATIONS.ZERO; i < array.length; i++) {
  // ...
}
```

## üîç Review Guidelines

### For Code Reviewers
<!-- 
INSTRUCTION: Guidelines for reviewing LLM-generated changes.
-->

**Focus Areas:**
1. **Constant Grouping:** Are constants logically organized?
2. **Naming Consistency:** Do names follow project conventions?
3. **Value Accuracy:** Are extracted values correct?
4. **Import Cleanliness:** Are imports organized properly?
5. **No Over-extraction:** Were obvious values left alone?

**Review Commands:**
```bash
# Check diff impact
git diff --stat

# Verify test coverage maintained
npm run test:coverage

# Check for accidental changes
git diff --name-only | grep -v constants
```

### Common Issues to Check
- [ ] Constants not properly typed
- [ ] Over-extraction of obvious values
- [ ] Missing imports in modified files
- [ ] Incorrect constant values
- [ ] Poor constant grouping/organization
