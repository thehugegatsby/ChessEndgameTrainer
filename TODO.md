  - [ ] Implement spaced repetition algorithm (FSRS-based)
  - [ ] Add progress tracking and analytics
- [ ] **Native Mobile Development** (Only after Web stability)
  - [ ] #19: Mobile platform implementation (currently 0%)
  - [ ] React Native integration with shared business logic
  - [ ] Platform-specific UI optimizations

## 📋 Archived/Deprecated Tasks

### Completed or No Longer Relevant
- [x] Clean Architecture Implementation (✅ Service → Adapter → Provider)
- [x] TypeScript Error Reduction (✅ 144→42 errors, 71% improvement)
- [x] Zustand Store Migration (✅ Single Source of Truth)
- [x] Engine Singleton Pattern (✅ Memory optimization)
- [x] Security: FEN Input Sanitization (✅ Implemented)
- ~~Mobile app components~~ (Removed - Web-first strategy)
- ~~Parallel Web/Mobile development~~ (Deferred - Resource constraints)

## 🔄 Development Workflow & Guidelines

### Quality Gates (Must Pass Before Deployment)
1. ✅ All unit tests pass (985/985)
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors  
3. ✅ ESLint passes
4. ✅ Build succeeds
5. ✅ E2E critical path tests pass (6/6 tests passing)

### Issue Triage Guidelines
- **P0 (Critical)**: UI bugs, test failures, security issues
- **P1 (High)**: Performance, missing features, user experience
- **P2 (Medium)**: Technical debt, optimizations, nice-to-have
- **P3 (Low)**: Future planning, research tasks

### Current Focus Strategy
**Web-First Development**
- Prioritize stability over new features
- Fix existing bugs before adding functionality  
- Establish solid testing foundation
- Mobile development deferred until web platform is stable

### Architecture Principles
- Clean Architecture: Service → Adapter → Provider
- Single Source of Truth: Zustand Store
- TypeScript Strict Mode
- Test-Driven Development where applicable
- Performance: <300KB bundle size per route

## ✅ Recently Completed (2025-07-13)

### Major Architectural Achievements
- [x] **Clean Architecture Implementation** - Service → Adapter → Provider layers
- [x] **TypeScript Modernization** - 144→42 errors (71% reduction)
