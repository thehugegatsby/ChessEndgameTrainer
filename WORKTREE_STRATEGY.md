```
src/tests/unit/services/ChessService.cache.test.ts
src/tests/unit/services/ChessService.germanPromotion.test.ts
src/tests/unit/services/ChessService.pgn.test.ts

```

#### Commands for This Worktree
```bash
# Navigate to worktree (in new terminal/VS Code window)
cd ../EndgameTrainer-critical-training-chess

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests to verify current state
pnpm test src/features/training  # Should show 0 tests
pnpm test src/features/chess-core # Should show 7 tests

# After migration, verify
pnpm test src/features/training  # Should show 5 tests
pnpm test src/features/chess-core # Should show 7+ tests (after dedup)
```

## Worktree Management Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Create new worktree
git worktree add -b feature/[name] ../EndgameTrainer-[name]

# Remove worktree after merge
git worktree remove ../EndgameTrainer-[name]

# Prune stale worktree references
git worktree prune
```

## Merge Strategy

1. Complete work in worktree
2. Push branch: `git push -u origin feature/[name]`
3. Create PR via GitHub
4. After merge, remove worktree locally
5. Delete remote branch

## Current Progress

- [x] Worktree 1 created: critical-training-chess
- [ ] Worktree 1 work complete
- [ ] Worktree 1 merged
- [ ] Worktree 2 created
- [ ] Worktree 3 created
- [ ] Worktree 4 created
- [ ] Worktree 5 created (LAST!)

## Notes for LLM Implementation

When working in the worktree:
1. You cannot navigate to worktree directory from main session
2. User must open new terminal/VS Code window for worktree
3. Each worktree has independent git history
4. Changes in worktree don't affect main until merged
5. Always verify tests pass before committing
